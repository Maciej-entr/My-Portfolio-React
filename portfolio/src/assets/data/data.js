Using React, I designed and implemented a frontend where users could: Search for cocktails by name, Add to favorites for easy access later, Check ratings to see others' opinions on drinks, I focused on creating a user-friendly and responsive design.

        story:
          "The goal of the project is to develop a program that tracks incoming emails and provides real-time notifications for important messages. The system would integrate with an email API to monitor email accounts and filter messages based on user-defined criteria, such as priority keywords, senders, or topics. For the frontend, I plan to use React to create a dynamic and responsive dashboard where users can view the status of their monitored emails. The dashboard would display a list of incoming emails, notifications for urgent messages, and options to customize settings like filtering rules or notification preferences. To enhance the user experience, I’d also integrate real-time updates using WebSocket or similar technologies so that the dashboard instantly reflects any new emails.In addition to React, I would incorporate other web development technologies, such as CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, ensuring the application is both functional and visually appealing. This project would help users stay organized by providing a simple and efficient way to monitor their inboxes without constantly checking for important messages.I’m excited about this potential project because it will allow me to sharpen my React skills, gain hands-on experience in building a complete application, and contribute to a useful tool for email management.",
